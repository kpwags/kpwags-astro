                Hi üëãüèª. My name is Keith, I'm a 30-something year old web developer living in the suburbs of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I graduated
                from Drexel University in 2007 with my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and have since spent my career working on both front-end
                and back-end development with a specialty in the .NET ecosystem. I am fortunate to have found a career where I can do what I love
                doing. Seeing websites and applications come to life is such an awesome thing, even more so when you're the one building them.
            </p>

            <p>
                This site is my little oasis within the wide world of the internet. I often write about things I read or hear, challenges I find, and
                a variety of things going on in my busy life. I also do my best to keep a <a href="/reading-logs">weekly reading log</a> of what I
                read and listen to.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have a wide variety of interests which always keeps me busy. Some of them include: software development, photography, writing,
                hockey, running, cooking, drawing, video games, and more. In reality, it's too much to constantly keep up with, but I stumble through.
